# Finding Donors for CharityML Using Supervised Learning
This project is part of Udacity Machine Learning Introduction Nanodegree Program (ND229).<br>
The goal is to find donors to CharityML, a fictious charity organization that was estabilished to provide financial 
support for those who are eager to learn machine learning.<br>
CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually, and
we will use supervised learning on data collected from 1994 U.S. census to identify people who probably are part of this
group.
